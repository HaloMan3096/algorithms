# My class work for 'Algorithms'

### Assignment I: Code Examples and Portfolio Start
- [x] Create methods that show: Constant O(1), Linear O(n), Quadratic O(n2)

<details> 
<summary> Constant </summary>  

  ```
    Console.WriteLine(args[0]);
  ```
  accessing the first member of a list is always in <b> Constant Time </b>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Linear </summary>

  ```
  foreach (var s in args)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(s);
  }
  ```
  Going through all of a list is in <b> Linear Time </b>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Quadratic </summary> 
  
  ```
  foreach (var s in args)
  {
    foreach (var v in args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(s + " " + v);
    }
  }
  ```
  Going through a list for each member in that list <sub> (looping through twice) </sub> is in <b> Quadratic Time </b>
</details>

### Assignment: Exponent Method in C#
- [x] Translate the code shown in the video to an algorithm in pseudocode.
- [x] Using what you learned in the The Idea Behind Big O Notation reading, analyze your algorithm using big O notation. What are the worst and best runtimes?

<details>
<summary> Algorithm </summary>

```
static int pow(int baseNum, int exponent) 
{
  var answer = 1;

  for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++)
  {
    answer *= baseNum;
  }
  return answer;
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> Pseudocode </summary> 
This has a Big O of O(n), because the time scales based on how large the exponent is

1. Identify the base and the power
2. Create a temp var to hold the solution
3. For the power we loop through and multiply temp var by the base
4. Return the temp var

### Assignment: Algorithm Creation and Analysis II (Matryoshka)
  <i>I might have gone a bit overboard on this one</i>
  
- [X] Part 1: Create an algorithm that will count how many dolls there are in total from all sets.
- [X] Part 2: Create an algorithm that will line the doll sets up from the one with the smallest nested amount to the largest.
- [X] Part 3: One of the dolls is unique and has the artistâ€™s signature on it. Create an algorithm that searches through all dolls in all sets until it finds the one with the signature (and then stops).
- [X] Analyze your algorithm using big O notation.

<details>
<summary>Part One: Count All</summary>  
  For this assignment I created a basic doll class that holds a reference to another doll class <i>(not unlike a linked list)</i>. 
  In the constructor for this class we take in an optional number, this number tells us how many dolls you want to create.
  In the constructor we recursivly call subtracting one from the inputted number.
  
  ```
    internal class NestingDoll
    {
      private readonly NestingDoll _innerDoll;
      private NestingDoll GetInnerDoll() { return _innerDoll; }
    
      public NestingDoll(int howManyInnerDolls = 1) 
      {
        _innerDoll = howManyInnerDolls <= 0 ? null : new NestingDoll(howManyInnerDolls - 1); 
      }

      public int CountInnerDolls()...
    }
  ```

  Then to get the actual count of inner dolls was simple, we know that the last doll will have an inner doll value of null.
  So we can loop through and increment an int and set the current doll to the old doll's inner doll.
  Once the current doll is null we have hit the end of the chain of dolls.

  ```
    public int CountInnerDolls()
    {
        var count = 0; 
        var currentDoll = this._innerDoll; 
        while (currentDoll != null) 
        {
            ++count; // We increment the count
            currentDoll = currentDoll.GetInnerDoll(); 
        }
        return count; 
    }
  ```

This gets us the number of dolls that are inside a doll and to get the total number of dolls inside a list of dolls we just have to loop through and count.
We set up a temp var named count that will hold our total number and loop through the list of dolls. we then add the current dolls count to the var.

```
  var count = 0;
  foreach (var doll in nestingDolls)
  {
    count += doll.CountInnerDolls();
  }
  Console.WriteLine($"Count: {count}");
```

This has a time complexity of O(n) since we only go through the list once here.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Part Two: Line Up Sets</summary>
  Here we want to take the list of dolls and line them up in order from smallest to largest. We continue to use the doll class from above.
  Since we are ordering a list I thought the best use of my time would be to use linq since its built to do that type of thing.

  ```
    IEnumerable<NestingDoll> smallestDolls = nestingDolls.OrderBy(dolls => dolls.CountInnerDolls());
    foreach (var doll in smallestDolls)
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"count: {doll.CountInnerDolls()}");
    }
  ```

  When it comes to sorting linq gives us the best time efficency of O(n<sup>2</sup>) since it uses bubble sort.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Part Three: Find Unique in Set</summary>
  Here we added a bool to the doll class that signifies that the doll is signed or not

  ```
  private bool _isSigned = false;
  ``` 

  ```
  public bool checkIfSigned()
  {
    return _isSigned;
  }
  ```

now that the doll has a signifier it is as simple as looping through the list of dolls and checking if the doll is signed.
if it is we can return that doll and do whatever we want with it.

```
public static NestingDoll findTheSignedOne(List<NestingDoll> nestingDolls)
    {
        foreach (var doll in nestingDolls)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"count: {doll.CountInnerDolls()}");
            if (doll.checkIfSigned())
            {
                return doll;
            }
        }
    }
```

This only checks the outside doll for a signiture allowing it to be O(n) since at most it only takes however many dolls there are in total. 
if you wanted to be able to hide the signiture further in you would have to loop through each of the dolls inner dolls this would make the time O(n<sup>2</sup>).

### Match 3 Recursion
- [ ] Create a 2D grid and populate it with numbers, present the entire 2D grid in the console window
- [ ] In order to play the game users will need to input a row and column
- [ ] The values above it need to "fall" and you need to fill the column back up
- [ ] Check if there are any matches made as a part of this process of numbers falling down in rows and columns
BONUS:
- [ ] Implement swapping
- [ ] powerup that destroys all of the values that the powerup swapped with

<details>
<summary>Point Class</summary>
A simple class that holds a value of our choice and has some basic functions. points with a value of - are dead cells and will be replaced.
the get_random_value() function is used to fill the grid and replace the values at the top of the list.

```
class Point
{
    public string value;
    public Point(string value = "-")
    {
        this.value = value; 
    }

    public static String get_random_value()
    {
        Random random = new();
        return random.Next(1,5).ToString();
    }
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>The Grid Class</summary>
Our grid class is only created the once and we call functions on it to modify the values of the grid. The grid class holds a list of list of points "Point[][]".

In the constructor we require a width and a height for the grid size. we then assign the grid to the height with "new Point[Height][]"

```
internal class Grid {
    public Point[][] grid;
    public int score = 0;

    public Grid( int width, int height )
    {
        grid = new Point[height][]; // Set up the outside array
        for (var i = 0; i < grid.Length; i++) // Set up the inner arrays
        {
            grid[i] = new Point[width];
        }
        this.fill_grid();
    }

    private void fill_grid()...

    public Point get_value(int x, int y)...

    public (int, int) get_coordinate_from_point(Point p)...

    public void destroy_value(int x, int y)...

    public void update_value(int x, int y)...
    
    public List<List<Point>> check_match()...
}
```

Once we have created the grid we then call fill_grid() on it. In this function we loop through both the outer and inner lists and create a new point with random values.
This is why we created the static get_random_value() on the point class.

```
private void fill_grid()
{
    foreach (var t in this.grid)
    {
        for (var y = 0; y < t.Length; y++) 
        {
            t[y] = new Point(Point.get_random_value());
        }
    }
}
```

  <details>
  <summary>get_value()</summary>
  We take two values an x and a y. We check that the point accually exists before sending back the point at the coordinate.

  We use this to find the point the user selects and then we "destroy" the value.

  ```
  public Point get_value(int x, int y) 
  {
      if (x > this.grid.Length || y > this.grid[0].Length)
      {
          return null;
      }
      return this.grid[x][y];
  }
  ```
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>get_coordinate_from_point()</summary>
  This is the inverse function from get_value(). this one takes in a Point and returns an x and y value.

  BUG: the result from this function actually ends up looking like (y, x) so when looking for y value later we should use item1 not item2

  ```
  public (int, int) get_coordinate_from_point(Point p)
  {
      var result = (-1, -1);
      for (var y = 0; y < this.grid.Length; y++)
      {
          for (var x = 0; x < this.grid[y].Length; x++)
          {
              if (this.grid[y][x] == p)
              {
                  result = (x, y);
              }
          }
      }
      return result;
  }
  ```
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>destroy_value()</summary>
  As we said in the Point class, any point with the value of "-" is considered dead. So to destroy a Point we change the points value to "-"

  ```
  public void destroy_value(int x, int y)
  {
      this.grid[x][y].value = "-";
  }
  ```
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>update_value()</summary>
  This function is called to do the drop-down effect. we loop through from the point that we "deleted". We check the y value of the point and make sure its not the top one.

  ```
  public void update_value(int x, int y)
  {
      if (x >= 1)
      {
          this.grid[x][y].value = this.grid[x - 1][y].value; 
      }
      if (x == 0) // if at the top we need a new random value
      {
          this.grid[x][y].value = Point.get_random_value();
          return; // we also want to escape the recursion when were at the top
      }
      this.update_value(x - 1, y); // as long as were not at the top of the list, we want to keep moving points down
  }
  ```
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>check_match()</summary>
  we want to return a list of the matches.

  ```
  public List<List<Point>> check_match()
  {
      List<List<Point>> matches = [];

      // HORIZONTAL
      foreach (var row in this.grid)
      {   // [Point, Point, Point...]
          List<Point> match = [row[0]];
          for (var x = 1; x < row.Length; x++)
          {
            if (row[x].value != match[0].value && match.Count < 3)
          {
            match.Clear();
            match.Add(row[x]);
            continue;
          }
          if (row[x].value == match[0].value)
          {
            match.Add(row[x]);
          }
        }
        if (match.Count >= 3)
        {
          matches.Add(match);
        }
        else
        {
          match.Clear();
        }
      }
        
      // VERTICAL
      foreach (var p in this.grid.Last())
      {
        List<Point> match = [p]; // Starting point
        var y = this.get_coordinate_from_point(p).Item1;
        for (var x = (this.grid.Length - 1); x > 0; x--)
        {
          if (this.grid[x][y].value != match[0].value && match.Count < 3)
          {
            match.Clear();
            match.Add(this.grid[x][y]);
            continue;
          }

          if (this.grid[x][y].value == match[0].value)
          {
            match.Add(this.grid[x][y]);
          }
        }
        if (match.Count >= 3)
        {
          matches.Add(match);
        }
        else
        {
          match.Clear();
        }
    }    
    return matches;
  }
  ```
